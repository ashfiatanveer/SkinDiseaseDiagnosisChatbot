Hives (Urticaria),"Hives, also known as urticaria, typically present as raised, itchy welts on the skin, varying in size and shape. These welts are often red or pink and may appear suddenly, disappearing within hours or persisting for days. They can occur singularly or cluster together, spreading across different parts of the body. Alongside the skin rash, hives may cause a burning or stinging sensation and occasionally trigger swelling of the lips, eyelids, or throat, leading to difficulty breathing or swallowing. In some cases, hives can be accompanied by fever, fatigue, or digestive issues, although these systemic symptoms are less common.",

Alongside these, non-inflammatory signs such as blackheads and whiteheads emerge, accompanied by redness, swelling, and oily skin. The condition often leads to scarring, especially when severe or untreated, impacting one's emotional well-being. Acne's range of symptoms visible lesions, skin texture changes, and psychological effects stems from factors like skin type, hormonal fluctuations, and lifestyle choices. Seeking guidance from a dermatologist aids in tailored treatment for managing these diverse manifestations effectively.",
Eczema,"Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, presents various symptoms that affect the skin's appearance and texture. Common manifestations include red or inflamed patches, often accompanied by intense itching, which can lead to scratching and subsequent skin thickening.

In severe cases, it can lead to painful cracks or fissures. Additionally, eczema might provoke sleep disturbances due to itching, impacting daily life and potentially causing emotional distress due to its persistent nature. Early diagnosis and proper management help alleviate symptoms and prevent flare-ups.",
